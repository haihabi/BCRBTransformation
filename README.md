# Reparameterization in Bayesian ParameterEstimation - Cram´er-Rao Bound
This repostory contin the code of the numrical experiment of the paper: Reparameterization in Bayesian ParameterEstimation - Cram´er-Rao Bound

Abstract: While the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) is a cornerstone in statistical signal processing, widely used in both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian frameworks, the special case of CRB after reparameterization has still some theoretical gaps.  
In cases where the CRB can not be directly evaluated on the parameters of interest, but can be derived from the CRB on another parameter vector, where the function relating the two vectors is given, there exist two known versions of the  reparameterized CRB under the non-Bayesian framework. In the Bayesian framework, only one version of the reparameterized bound is known. In this paper, for the first time, a second, alternative version of reparameterized Bayesian CRB (BCRB) is derived. Analyzing the two versions of reparameterized BCRB, we show that unlike the non-Bayesian case, in which there is a clear order relation between the two bounds, in the Bayesian framework, neither bound uniformly dominates the other. Moreover, the existence conditions of the two bounds differ, further justifying the relevance of both. In particular, we explore the relations between the two bounds in some specific cases, and illustrate the finding through several practical examples.
